# PHD_Progress_June_2023
Shows figures for my June 2023 progress report. Attached is also the .prm files to create the associated figures.

# Parameter files
- **2D_Continental_Extension** - A 2D continental extension model that uses the GMG solver as well as particles. Used to create figure 2.
- **3D_Periodic_Boundaries** - A 3D continental extension model that uses periodic boundary conditions on the front and back. Used to create figure 3.
- **3D_Function_Boundaries** - A 3D continental extension model that uses function boundary conditions on the front and back. Used to create figure 4.

# Figures

![Fig 1  Gantt Chart Year 2 updated](https://github.com/Lukel13/PHD_Progress_June_2023/assets/95885918/14806592-7f81-43e8-8d2e-ffbbeae96df3)
**Figure 1.** A gantt chart designed in early April 2023 outlinining my plans during the second year of my PhD. A grey bar seperates each month with the gantt chart starting in April and ending at the end of December. Yellow bars show periods of background reading, light green bars show periods of testing and learning how to use software, light blue bars show periods where my final models are running, orange bars show trips, dark blue bars represent times I'm giving lectures and red bars represent university deadlines. 

![Fig 2  2D extension](https://github.com/Lukel13/PHD_Progress_June_2023/assets/95885918/b285495f-ce99-41ae-9e79-ea9fd27c9e6e)
**Figure 2.** A 2D continental extension model with a spreading rate of 0.5 cm/year on the left and right boundaries. The dark brown layer is the upper curst, the light brown layer is the lower crust and the blue is the mantle. White arrows are also overlain and scale with velocities.

![Fig 3  3D periodic extension](https://github.com/Lukel13/PHD_Progress_June_2023/assets/95885918/d44e4960-2fd9-4122-8a55-6ff5a764e5ee)
**Figure 3.** A 3D extensional model that uses periodic boundaries on the front and back. A spreading rate of 1 cm/yr is applied to the left and right boundaries with the model being extended to the southwest-northeast. Dark blue represents the upper curst, light blue layer represents lower crust and the red represents the mantle.

![Fig 4  3D function extension](https://github.com/Lukel13/PHD_Progress_June_2023/assets/95885918/a3131f79-771d-41a1-ac34-0e3c7412ce4b)
**Figure 4.** A 3D extensional model that uses function boundaries on the front and back. A spreading rate of 0.5 cm/yr is applied to the left and right boundaries with the model being extended to the northwest-southeast. Dark blue represents the upper curst, light blue represents the lower crust and red represents the mantle. Only a small area of the model is visualied to mitigate edge effects.

**Figure 5.** Image submitted to the University of Derbyâ€™s 2023 Images of Research Photography Competition demonstrating how oceanic basins and transform faults develop.
