![Fig 1  Gantt Chart Year 2 updated](https://github.com/Lukel13/PHD_Progress_June_2023/assets/95885918/e665f51c-5e55-4149-8d0c-0689dfd36a3a)
**Figure 1.** A gantt chart designed in early April 2023 outlinining my plans during the second year of my PhD. A grey bar seperates each month with the gantt chart starting in April and ending at the end of December. Yellow bars show periods of background reading, light green bars show periods of testing and learning how to use software, light blue bars show periods where my final models are running, orange bars show trips, dark blue bars represent times I'm giving lectures and red bars represent university deadlines.

**Figure 2.** A 2D continental extension model with a spreading rate of 0.5 cm/year on the left and right boundaries. The dark brown layer is the upper curst, the light brown layer is the lower crust and the blue is the mantle. White arrows are also overlain and scale with velocities.

![Fig 3  3D periodic extension](https://github.com/Lukel13/PHD_Progress_June_2023/assets/95885918/d44e4960-2fd9-4122-8a55-6ff5a764e5ee)
**Figure 3.** A 3D extensional model that uses periodic boundaries on the front and back. A spreading rate of 1 cm/yr is applied to the left and right boundaries with the model being extended to the southwest-northeast. The Dark blue layer is the upper curst, the light blue layer is the lower crust and the red is the mantle. White arrows are also overlain and scale with velocities.
